  <h1 style="text-align:center">About Me</h1>

  <p style="text-align:center">Hello, my name is Miguel Herrera, I will talk about my personal life. I am currently 15,turning 16 November 27. I am a junior from Sanger High School. I like to play sports, and when I say sports I mean any sport. Some people may know me as "Michael" because when I was younger my mom bought me some Jordan's shoes. Ever since then people has been calling me "Michael" because of my shoes, and some will say because that's the way to say it in english. Lately I've been traveling to other countries like Portugal, Germany, Italy, etc. and the reason being is because I like to take pictures of places that I travel to keep memories, and all that started back when my uncle introduced me into the open world. Me and him used to travel until on May 25, 2014 he sadly passed away from a tumor. I told myself when I get older I'm going to travel around the world to be as happy as him.</p>
