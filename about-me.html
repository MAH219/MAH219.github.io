  <h1>About Me Pt. 2</h1>

  <p>I like to play many sports, and when I say many sports I mean a whole lot of them. I can literally play anything, although I would not be good at some but I'll still enjoy playing.</p>
  <p>
    I also like traveling to different place of the world. The reaon being Is because I like taking pictures of many historical attractions.

    I am a gentle and patient guy, what I mean by that is that I do not get mad easy, It is very hard for me to get mad... well sometimes not really, It depends the situation.
